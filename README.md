🐍 Snake Game in Python
Welcome to the Snake Game! This project is a classic implementation of the Snake game, developed using Python's turtle graphics module. The game is simple, fun, and a great way to learn about basic game development concepts in Python.

🎮 How to Play
Objective: The goal of the game is to control the snake and eat the food that appears randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
Controls:
Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to change the direction of the snake.
The game ends if the snake collides with the screen border or itself.
Score: Your score increases with each piece of food eaten. Try to beat your high score!

🛠️ Features
Simple Controls: Easy to use arrow keys for controlling the snake.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your score, showing it on the screen as you play.
Game Over: A message appears when the snake collides with the wall or itself, allowing you to restart the game.

📚 Dependencies
This game requires Python 3.x and the turtle module, which is included with Python by default. No additional installations are required.
